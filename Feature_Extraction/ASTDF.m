% To find the absolute standard deviation of the signal, first the
% difference between the EOG signals from Left and Right has to be found by
% subtraction. After, the standard deviation can be calculated by
% subtracting the mean value from the specific value, squaring the outcome,
% summing all of those values together, and dividing this by the number of
% samples -1
