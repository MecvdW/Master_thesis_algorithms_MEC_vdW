function TotalEnergy = EPS(data,datalength)
%Power of a signal can be found by calculating the square of the signal at
%every time step and than summing all together and dividing by the length
%of the time step. The chosen windows for the calculation of the square is
%1s, the chosen window for the calculation of the power is 30s.
TotalEnergy = (sum(data.^2))/(length(datalength));
