%% Isolation Forest
% IForest was chosen to ignore due to the splitting method that is used
% when categorical variables have too many categories (64), since most of
% our features are differing, this is not usable and the accuracy of the
% classifier is too low

% To compensate for this, it was decided to use the TreeBagger feature
% selection method as a 3rd method
