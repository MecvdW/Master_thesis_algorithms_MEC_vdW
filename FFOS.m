function FormF = FFOS(data)
% The form factor of the signal can be calculated by dividing the RMS of
% the signal by the squared absolute mean of the signal
% First calculate the squared of the mean of the signal
absquad = data.^2;
abssqrt = sqrt(absquad);
abssqrt2 = sqrt(abssqrt);
absmean = sum(abssqrt2)/length(data);
% Now calculate the form factor
FormF = rms(data)/absmean;
